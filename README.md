Airbnb Price Prediction & Investment Analysis
This project predicts Airbnb listing prices and identifies top investment opportunities using multiple machine learning models. It processes and enriches listing data, compares model performances, and visualizes high-potential listings on interactive maps.

Features
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Handles property attributes (beds, baths, room type, review scores, etc.)

Calculates advanced metrics such as price per accommodate, bed-bath ratio, and distance to downtown using the Haversine formula.

Machine Learning Models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)

Model Evaluation:

Compares models using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.

Investment Scoring:

Custom scoring system factoring price thresholds, availability, and review ratings.

Visualization:

Interactive Folium maps highlighting top investment listings.

Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Folium

Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
